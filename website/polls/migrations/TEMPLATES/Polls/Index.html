        <!---
The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes.
 In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary
 lookup on the object question.
  Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case.
  If attribute lookup had failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup.

Method-calling happens in the {% for %} loop: question.choice_set.all
is interpreted as the Python code question.choice_set.all(),
which returns an iterable of Choice objects and is suitable for use in the {% for %} tag.

    </ul>
{% else %}
    <p>No polls are available.</p>
{% endif %}
